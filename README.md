Earthquake Explorer is an interactive web application that lets you discover and monitor earthquake events from around the globe using a free API. The app retrieves up-to-date earthquake data—including essential details such as magnitude, location, depth, and time—and showcases the events on a responsive map interface. Built with modern web technologies, Earthquake Explorer ensures a smooth and engaging user experience on any device.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Free API Integration:** Fetch real-time earthquake data using a free API (e.g., the USGS Earthquake API).
- **Comprehensive Details:** View important details for each earthquake event, including magnitude, location, depth, and occurrence time.
- **Interactive Map:** Explore earthquake events visually with interactive map integration that plots each event.
- **Filtering & Pagination:** Easily navigate through earthquake records with filtering options and paginated results.
- **Dynamic Modal Display:** Click on an event card to open a modal window with detailed information and a zoomed-in map view of the epicenter.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- **Bootstrap 5**
- **Leaflet.js** (or any preferred mapping library for interactive maps)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Earthquake Explorer is designed to run in modern web browsers with no extra dependencies required. For development, a code editor with live preview functionality (such as Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension) is recommended.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/earthquake-explorer.git cd earthquake-explorer


2. **Launch the Application**

- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
- Alternatively, use a live-reload server through your code editor to preview changes in real time.

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** The application uses JavaScript’s Fetch API to retrieve earthquake data from a free API, such as the USGS Earthquake API, processing the JSON response to generate a list of earthquake events.
- **Interactive Mapping:** Each earthquake is plotted on an interactive map (using Leaflet.js or a similar tool), allowing users to visually explore the geographical distribution of events.
- **Event Details:** Clicking on an earthquake card opens a modal window with further details, including a zoomed-in map view and additional metadata like the depth and time of occurrence.
- **Pagination & Filtering:** The app divides data into manageable pages and provides filtering options (e.g., by magnitude or date) to help you quickly find specific events.
